My name is Matthew Herman. I am currently studying Computer Science at NYU. This website has been created for a course, which I am currently taking, called Open Source Software Development.

### More Information

I am particularly interested in Open Source projects that enable people to create websites and assist with online business. My favourite open source project is currently Bootstrap.
