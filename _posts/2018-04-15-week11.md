### Team progress
We are still sticking to the original plan of working on correcting error caused by API changes in the examples repo and creating new examples.

Personally I have been working on improving the top down game example and will aim to submit the pull request for it this week. I am thinking it may be a good example to create around 5 very simple examples from the implementations in the top down shooter example, because the code is getting very complex in comparison to the other examples.

### My Contributions This Week
