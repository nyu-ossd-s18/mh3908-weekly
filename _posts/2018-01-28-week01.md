# Open Source
#### What do I think about when I hear open source?
I think open source describes a type of project. It implies that for the project there are limited restrictions on who may contribute to the project and in what manner they do so. It also implies that the project remains transparent to the public so that anyone can use any part of the project for their own use with limited restrictions. This enables a community to form from people who primarily want to collaborate and contribute to the project. 

#### Advantages of open source vs closed source
The main advantages of open sourcing projects are that it enables a lot of people to collaborate on the same project and allows for free (as in freedom, not free hot dogs) use of project code or product. Collaboration brings more manpower and can produce a high quality product. Free use of the product enables people who would otherwise be unable to afford the proprietary-source equivalent to benefit greatly.

#### Potential problems in Open Source projects
Project organization is potentially more difficult and a certain amount of manpower is used up in handling the organization of the product. Also, it is possible for major disagreements to occur between contributors

# Projects
#### Four open source projects I regularly use
1. Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a framework for making website with HTML, CSS, and javascript and its source code is in SASS, a CSS pre-processor. The documentation for this framework is amazing; it has best documentation I have ever seen. When I was around 15 I first learnt to make websites using Bootstrap. The documentation for bootstrap was easier for me to understand than the documentation on w3schools.com, and allowed me to immediately start making websites. Last summer whilst working, I developed the pre-launch website for the HAZZA ICO using primarily bootstrap. I've benefited economically as well as intellectually from this open source project. Instead of using Bootstrap, one could use an open source CMS like Wordpress (don't though) or Drupal, or just create a custom framework. However the CMSs are more complex, slower, and take up more memory, so they are really only good if you want to make a certain type of website.

2. Ethereum

Ethereum is a crypto currency with a Turing complete virtual machine that can execute code. I have purchased the Ethereum crypto currency and also other crypto currencies that use the Ethereum blockchain to record transactions.

3. Eclipse

Eclipse provides IDEs for popular languages like C, C++, Java, JavaScript and PHP. I use the Eclipse IDE for Java and it is very helpful because of all the features it has such as providing suggestions for automatic corrections for errors. There are too many alternative IDEs to list. Some of the recently popular IDEs are Atom and Sublime.

4. GCC

The GCC is a compiler for C code.
