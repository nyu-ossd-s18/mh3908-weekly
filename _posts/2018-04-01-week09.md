### My Contributions This Week

I noticed that the documentation for a method that enables keyboard input, would always result in an error. I checked other examples that used the method properly and it seems the example was passing an argument that was from an out of date API. I reported the issue and created a codepen that demonstrates the erroneous and proper arguments to pass to the method.
