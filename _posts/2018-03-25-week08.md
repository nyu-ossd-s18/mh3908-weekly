### My Contributions This Week
Link to contribution 1: <https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples/issues/67>

I noticed that a duplicate issue was created for a bug I was working on in Phaser3, so I commented about it and the author closed the duplicate issue.

I have been working to solve this issue and have narrowed it down to a function that stops a tweens (an object that automatically moves a sprite/image in a predetermined way during the game loop). The function that stops the tween sometimes results in setting the y variable of the sprite/image to 0, instead of setting it to its original position.

I am trying to solve some of the issues opened by one user who is opening issues to report examples on labs.phaser.io, which are not working. I noticed that the broken example (throwing an undefined funciton error) was not the same version of the most recent example in the repository, so I commented that, and I suggested that this issue can be resolved by updating labs.phaser.io with the current version of the repository.
