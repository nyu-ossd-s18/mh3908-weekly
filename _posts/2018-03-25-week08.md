I noticed that a duplicate issue was created for a bug I was working on in Phaser3, so I commented about it and the author closed the duplicate issue.

I have been working to solve this issue and have narrowed it down to a function that stops a tweens (an object that automatically moves a sprite/image in a predetermined way during the game loop). The function that stops the tween sometimes results in setting the y variable of the sprite/image to 0, instead of setting it to its original position.
