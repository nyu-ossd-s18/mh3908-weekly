Open Data Week Events

### NYU data talk
The NYU data talk had three panelists who were involved with Open data. The talk was primarily about how Open Data is enforced by law in NYC, and how different government agencies make their data into Open data. I think it was interesting to see how Open Data works in the real world and to compare it to Open Source software development. The different panelists also had different perspectives on Open Data. One was a lawyer, one was a researcher who used open data, and the other was another kind of academic. 

### Talk Data to me
This event was postponed to April 7th and it was the only event I could attend this week so I'll see it then.
